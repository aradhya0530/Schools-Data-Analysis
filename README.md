# Schools-Data-Analysis

### Project Summary: School Data Analysis and Visualization

This project involves analyzing and visualizing school performance data to derive insights about student performance, subject strengths, and growth trends across multiple years. The dataset includes student marks across subjects (Hindi, English, Mathematics, etc.), total marks, ranks, school names, and yearly growth metrics for 2019 and 2021.

**Technologies Used:**
1.. **Excel**: Data was initially provided in Excel format and firstly cleaned and then  directly for visualization using formulas. link-(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w8KOhrRcq-uyM-SaogDIga8Z02xCdZbHefmrGWxXz0o/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

2. **BigQuery**: Although initially explored for SQL-based data manipulation, Tableau was used for direct visualization without additional database connections.
3. 
4. **Tableau**: For interactive dashboards and visualizations to present insights.

**Key Visualizations:**
1. **Top Performers by Years**: Identifies top 10 students by total marks in a given year.
2. 
3. **Top performing Schools**: Highlights total performance of each school.
4. 
5. **Growth analysis over years**: Showcases School wise growth in streams over the years
6. 
7. **Subject wise Schools Comparison**: Showcases School wise comparison in different subjects.

This project demonstrates how to clean, analyze, and visualize educational performance data effectively using industry-standard tools.
